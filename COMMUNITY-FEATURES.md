Did a cool thing with the theme and want to share it with rest of the Hello Friend theme users? Jump in!

Please follow the template:

- **NAME_OF_THE_FEATURE** (LINK TO YOUR FORK)
  - SHORT DESCRIPTION
  - SOMETHING ABOUT YOU (name and who you are / what you do / etc.)

eg:

- **Social media icons** (https://github.com/...)
  - This was a big missing feature of the theme. It will help your audience reach you over the internet.

- **Photo gallery collections** (https://github.com/paulcoghlan/hugo-theme-hello-friend)
  - I wanted to move a large collection of personal photos from Smugmug to a static-generated site.
  - Adds two types:
    - gallery - a set of images in directory
    - collection - group of galleries to be used as primary navigation
  - The theme allows you to turn a hierarchy of photo directories into a static website with the aid of an
  import tool [https://github.com/paulcoghlan/hugo-gallery].
  - Note this theme isn't intended to be a portfolio site, it more about making it easy to manage a large number 
  of photo galleries.
